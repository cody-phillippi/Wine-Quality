# Wine-Quality

The goal of this notebook is to get a hands on approach with a few different ML models (KNN, Decision Tree, SVC & random forest) and a few different model techniques (bagging & stacking) to see if we can produced a generalized model to predict wine quality. We did not perform any feature engineerings here. This was just to get hnads on practice training these different models with Hyperparam tuning
